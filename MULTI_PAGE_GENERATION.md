## ✨ What's New

### 🎯 Smart Auto-Detection

The generator now **automatically detects** when a multi-page website is appropriate:

**Triggers Multi-Page Generation:**
- ✅ Business websites
- ✅ Company websites  
- ✅ Corporate websites
- ✅ Restaurants (generates: index, about, menu, reservations, contact)
- ✅ Service businesses (generates: index, about, services, pricing, contact)
- ✅ E-commerce (generates: index, products, about, contact, cart)
- ✅ Portfolios (generates: index, about, portfolio, services, contact)
- ✅ Blogs (generates: index, blog, about, contact)
- ✅ Any website with `mode: 'full'`
- ✅ Advanced/Enterprise complexity
- ✅ When user mentions "full website" or "complete website"

**Stays Single-Page:**
- ❌ Explicitly says "single page" or "landing page only"
- ❌ `layout: 'single-page'` or `layout: 'landing'`
- ❌ Simple landing pages
